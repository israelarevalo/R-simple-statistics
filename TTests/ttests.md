## Before we start

This guide was designed as a friendly approach to learn how to conduct
statistical analysis within the R environment. R is a powerful
open-source tool that allows for great flexibility and customization of
when conducting data wrangling (cleaning), analysis, interpretation, and
reporting. Did I mention its open-source? This not only means that it is
free, but the entire code used to develop this exceptional language is
entirely available for you to view (and even suggest changes) online.

Several assumptions about the user will be made within this guide. If
these assumptions are not met, here are a few guides to reference that
will get you up to speed \[insert link to R installation here\]. 1. You
have installed R and an IDE such as RStudio on your computer 2. You have
a dataset to work with (preferably in .csv format)
