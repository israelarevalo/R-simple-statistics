## Introduction

This guide was created to assist a new user of R in importing your dataset. R is a powerful tool that allows the user to import a variety of data types (i.e., .csv, .sas, .dat, and more). 

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

Some data types will require for you to take an additional step before you can successfully import your data. 

:::


Specifically, these data types include:

* data 1
* data 2
* data 3

For this reason, I recommend you start with a .csv file if you are able to. If you have an alternative data type specific to a particular statistical package (i.e., SPSS), you can export your dataset into a .csv format; however, the steps to that procedure are beyond the scope of this article. 

If you are unable to initially import your data as a .csv format, scroll to the bottom 


## Importing from a Mac environment

To begin our tutorial, we will discuss importing your dataset from within a Mac environment. Several assumptions are made prior to this process. 

1. You have installed R on your computer.
2. You have installed an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Rstudio on your computer.
3. You have a dataset that you can import into RStudio.

```{r}

# Importing dataset from existing file and calling it 'df'

#df <- read.csv('dataset.csv')


```

# Importing from a Windows environment

Importing your data within a Windows environment is very similar to what we have dissed up to this point. Also, we will be making the same assumptions we have previously discussed (installed R, installed RStudio, and have a dataset).
