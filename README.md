## Simple R Statistics Tutorials

This guide was designed as a friendly approach to learn how to conduct statistical analysis within the R environment. R is a powerful open-source tool that allows for great flexibility and customization of when conducting data wrangling (cleaning), analysis, interpretation, and reporting. Did I mention its open-source? This not only means that it is free, but the entire code used to develop this exceptional language is entirely available for you to view (and even suggest changes) online.

This repository contains a variety of tutorials designed for the beginning R user that is either starting with R as their first statistical analysis environment or for those that are wanting to see what R has to offer. Regardless of where you are in your statistical journey, this repository of tutorials are designed to be easy to follow and provide you with sample code that can be easily copied and pasted into your R environment.

Each tutorial is made using [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org) within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). All documents are available to download through this github repository.
