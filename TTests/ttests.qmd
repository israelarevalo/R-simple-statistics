## Before we start

This guide was designed as a friendly approach to learn how to conduct statistical analysis within the R environment. R is a powerful open-source tool that allows for great flexibility and customization of when conducting data wrangling (cleaning), analysis, interpretation, and reporting. Did I mention its open-source? This not only means that it is free, but the entire code used to develop this exceptional language is entirely available for you to view (and even suggest changes) online.

Several assumptions about the user will be made within this guide. Specifically, it is assumed that you have already installed R and an IDE such as RStudio on your computer. It is also assumed that you have a dataset to work with (preferably in .csv format). If these assumptions are not met, here are a few guides to reference that will get you up to speed.



```{r}
a = 2+2
print(a)
